crib-dragger
============

A simple script for crib dragging against many-time pads I preiodically use for CTFs. Pass in your crib and the target messages in a file,
Once you've started gathering parts of the key stick them in 'key' and it will print the decrypted messages so far at the end of the list
of cribbed message attempts.
